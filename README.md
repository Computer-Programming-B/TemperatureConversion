Temperature Conversion
======================
Your assignment is to write a program that converts a list of temperatures in Fahrenheit to Celsius and displays the result. The formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is *Celisus =(Fahrenheit-32)(5/9)*. You may find slides 79 - 89 of the [Computer Programming B slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rICcmNbnGYsB-cV_6EatPyzcOS2sId80Jh2kayUzm4Q/edit?usp=sharing) helpful. Your program will be very similar to the program shown on slide 89.

Suggested Steps to complete this assignment:
1. Start a new Python program in repl.it and give it a meaningful name like `TemperatureConversion`. 
2. Create a list of temperatures with code like `temps = [212,32,-40]`
3. Create a `for each` loop to traverse the list and `print()` the numbers in the list to the screen
4. Now add more `print()` statements to the for each loop that labels the temperatures, converts them to Celsius and displays the results. Remember that an extra argument `end=' '` in a `print()` will end the line with a space rather than a newline character. Your output should look something like this.
