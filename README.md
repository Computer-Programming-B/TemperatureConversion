Temperature Conversion
======================
Your assignment is to write a program that converts a list of temperatures in Fahrenheit to Celsius and displays the result. The formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is *Celisus =(Fahrenheit-32)(5/9)*. You may find slides 121 - 143 of the PythonProcessing.pptx PowerPoint slides helpful. This assignment is very similar to the program on slide 135.

Suggested Steps to complete this assignment:
1. Start a new program in Processing. 
2. Create a list of temperatures with code like `temps = [212,32,-40]`
3. Create a for each loop to traverse the list and `print()` the numbers in the list to the screen
4. Now add more `print()` statements to the for each loop that label the temperatures, convert them to Celsius and display the results. Remember that an extra argument `end=' '` in a `print()` will end the line with a space rather than a newline character. Your output should look something like this.
